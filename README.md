### How do I approach designing software?

My approach to coding and project creation has been significantly altered by taking part in this course. I think it was an eye opener to experience the scope and difficulty of a project of this calibre. In the beginning, I mostly would have just googled a problem, and tried to implement whatever solution I needed. Here, it was different. Since you need to know how to solve the problems before you can implement them, it's very important to study up and make sure that the topics are understood and make sense before anything can be done.

Working out what needed to be done, figuring out all the different ways that it can be implemented, and then choosing the best one that works for this case and for the  other parts that need to be created later is very important. Understanding where the project needs to go and figuring out how to get there before working was also the main way I learned to tackle the different problems and projects. I think that these tactics will apply to any project in the future, as it's always good to break down the project before doing anything, and then taking the time to figure out all the different parts individually and how they will work together.

### How do I approach developing programs?

The actual development was even more profound. I struggled many times to actually implement the things that I had decided to do. Many times, the supposed solution to the problem was incorrect, or filled with bugs and errors. It was very necessary to try a solution, and then alter it over time until it worked, fixing bugs and improving it as best as can be done, before moving onto the next part of the project. This helps to make sure that, when moving on, everything works before new code is written. This sort of iterated process would then be applied until the goals have been met.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

At the end of the day, computer science is all about using computers to solve problems. Having these computational gaphis and visualizations as a possible implementation for solving a problem is a great help. We might want implement something that uses graphics to map it out, or some other goal that a graphical project might be able to achieve. That's why it's so important to have the skills to apply these different concepts. This not only goes for solutions in the education pathway, but especially in the professional one, as many business, companies, and even people are looking for ways to implement their ideas, solve problems, and create software that can benefit them and others. This is where graphics and computers come in, as they are one of the best tools we have of solving these problems. That's only if we have the skills to be able to.
